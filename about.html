        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Augie’s was started in 1972 by Augie Cordero. At that time Augie repaired mostly
        all equipment that has to do with water such as, washing machines, water heaters,
        and water softeners. Hence Augie’s Water Systems original name, Augie’s Repair. 
        Towards the end of the seventies, Augie became too busy with all the repair work, 
        and he realized he was repairing more softeners than anything else. So Augie decided
        work strictly with water conditioning. At the turn of the decade Augie took all 
        the best ideas from the water softeners at the time and built his own (the same basic
        design we use today).</p>
        <p>In 1992, John Cordero, took over the business from his father Augie. During the early
        years of John owning the business, he saw the need for a better reverse osmosis system.
        John worked with Challenger to design the Conqueror IV system that we use today. John
        continued through the nineties to continue the awesome reputation of Augie’s. Toward
        the end of the decade a third generation of the Cordero family joined the business, Nicholas Cordero.</p>
        <p>Nicholas has been working for Augie’s for over ten years now. He has brought his own new
        ideas to the business and of course he continues with the reputation of the company. From 1998 to 2008,
        John and Nicholas worked together to provide the Santa Barbara area with all its water conditioning needs.
        In 2008, Johns second son, Jason Cordero, joined the team. He has brought his college degree to the crew.
        With that college degree comes new ideas for the company.
